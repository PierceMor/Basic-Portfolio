        <p>
            My name is Pierce Morrill. I graduated college two years ago
            with a degree in German and Anthropolgy. My work history consists of 
            customer service, primarily in the service industry. I am currently working
            customer service for a gaming company as a german liason. 
            <br><br>
            After coding boot camp I plan on continueing my Coding Journey within Austin Tx.
            Texas being the greatest country in the United States, with Austin at its heart.            
            <br><br>
            For hobbies I usually just train Brazilain Jiu Jitsu, which has been put on hold for this course.
            I have found that Jiu Jitsu has provided me with a well rounded understanding of my learning career. 
            For to stop learn is to trully be dead.
