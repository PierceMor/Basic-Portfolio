            My name is Pierce Morrill. I graduated college two years ago
            with a degree in German and Anthropolgy. My work history consists of 
            customer service, primarily in the service industry. I am currently working
            customer service for a gaming company as a german liason. 
            <br><br>
            After coding boot camp I plan on continueing my Coding Journey within Austin Tx.
            Texas being the greatest country in the United States, with Austin at its heart.
            I want to right some more filler here.

            My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

            Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.
